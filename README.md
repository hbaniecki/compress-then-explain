### Start: examples

In `examples`, we provide 4 Jupyter notebooks with simple code examples on how to use CTE to improve the estimation of SHAP, SAGE, Expected Gradients, and Feature Effects.

### Details: experiments

In `experiments`, we provide code to reproduce the results reported in Section 4 of the paper.
